This software package contains three different programs for producing solutions to the so-called Minimum Global Domination problem, which is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem.

You will need a rather recent version of the GCC compiler for C++ installed on your system for compiling the software. Moreover, you will need ILOG CPLEX installed on your system. Before calling the compiler executing 'make', you also have to change 2 paths in the file 'Makefile' such that your system knows were to find the CPLEX installation. 

Examples for executing the three programs:

./greedy -i <instance_file_name>    -> executes a simple greedy heuristic
./cplex -i <instance_file_name> -t <time_limit_in_seconds>
./cmsa -i <instance_file_name> -t <time_limit_in_seconds> 

Note that the CMSA algorithm has a series of parameters. You find them looking at the pseudo-code 'cmsa.cpp'. All of them have a preset value, but you can also change them by means of command line options (have a look at the code).
